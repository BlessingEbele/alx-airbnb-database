# 🏡 ALX Airbnb Database Project

Welcome to the **Airbnb Database Design Project**, part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. This project demonstrates the complete design and implementation of a relational database system for an Airbnb-like application. It covers everything from entity-relationship modeling to schema creation and data seeding.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Apply advanced principles of database design to model real-world systems.
* Normalize relational data up to 3NF to reduce redundancy.
* Use SQL DDL to define schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
* Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed realistic sample data.
* Collaborate professionally using Git and GitHub for documentation and version control.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL** — PostgreSQL (can be adapted for MySQL)
* **Draw\.io** / **dbdiagram.io** — for ER diagram modeling
* **Git** / **GitHub** — version control and project hosting
* **Markdown** — documentation formatting
