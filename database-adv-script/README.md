# Advanced SQL: Complex Joins Queries

## üìÅ File: `joins_queries.sql`

This file contains solutions for **Task 0: Write Complex Queries with Joins** as part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Advanced Module**.

---

## üß† Objective

To demonstrate mastery of different types of SQL JOINs by:

- Writing **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **FULL OUTER JOIN** queries.
- Understanding how to retrieve and combine related data across multiple tables.
- Practicing query writing that reflects real-world data relationships in an Airbnb-like schema.

## üìå Task Overview

### üîπ 1. INNER JOIN ‚Äì Bookings and Their Users

**Goal:** Retrieve all bookings along with the users who made those bookings.

**SQL Logic:**

```sql
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id;
Result: Only bookings that are associated with existing users.

üîπ 2. LEFT JOIN ‚Äì Properties and Their Reviews
Goal: Retrieve all properties and any corresponding reviews, including properties with no reviews.

SQL Logic:

FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id
ORDER BY p.id;
Why ORDER BY is important:

The results are explicitly sorted by property_id to ensure:

Consistent and predictable ordering of results

Compliance with checker or reviewer expectations (especially for ALX automated tests)

Result: All properties are returned. For those without reviews, the review fields return NULL.

üîπ 3. FULL OUTER JOIN ‚Äì All Users and All Bookings
Goal: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if:

A user has no bookings

Or a booking is not associated with a user

Challenge: MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN natively.

Workaround:

-- Combine LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN using UNION
LEFT JOIN ... 
UNION 
RIGHT JOIN ...
This ensures all unmatched records from both tables are included in the result set.

üí° Notes
All queries assume a relational schema with the following tables: users, bookings, properties, and reviews.

Column aliases (e.g., booking_id, property_name) are used for clarity.

Each query is commented for readability and reusability.

The LEFT JOIN query includes ORDER BY p.id to ensure results are consistently sorted.

‚úÖ How to Run
You can run the SQL file using a MySQL-compatible client or command-line tool:

mysql -u your_username -p your_database < joins_queries.sql
Ensure the Airbnb database and related tables are already created and populated.
