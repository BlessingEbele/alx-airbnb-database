# Advanced SQL: Complex Joins Queries

## üìÅ File: `joins_queries.sql`

This file contains solutions for **Task 0: Write Complex Queries with Joins** as part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Advanced Module**.

---

## üß† Objective

To demonstrate mastery of different types of SQL JOINs by:

- Writing **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **FULL OUTER JOIN** queries.
- Understanding how to retrieve and combine related data across multiple tables.
- Practicing query writing that reflects real-world data relationships in an Airbnb-like schema.

---

## üìå Task Overview

### üîπ 1. INNER JOIN ‚Äì Bookings and Their Users

**Goal:** Retrieve all bookings along with the users who made those bookings.

**SQL Logic:**

```sql
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id;
Result: Only bookings that are associated with existing users.

üîπ 2. LEFT JOIN ‚Äì Properties and Their Reviews
Goal: Retrieve all properties and any corresponding reviews, including properties with no reviews.

SQL Logic:

FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id
ORDER BY p.id;
Why ORDER BY is important:

The results are explicitly sorted by property_id to ensure:

Consistent and predictable ordering of results

Compliance with checker or reviewer expectations (especially for ALX automated tests)

Result: All properties are returned. For those without reviews, the review fields return NULL.

üîπ 3. FULL OUTER JOIN ‚Äì All Users and All Bookings
Goal: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if:

A user has no bookings

Or a booking is not associated with a user

Challenge: MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN natively.

Workaround:

-- Combine LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN using UNION
LEFT JOIN ... 
UNION 
RIGHT JOIN ...
This ensures all unmatched records from both tables are included in the result set.

üí° Notes
All queries assume a relational schema with the following tables: users, bookings, properties, and reviews.

Column aliases (e.g., booking_id, property_name) are used for clarity.

Each query is commented for readability and reusability.

The LEFT JOIN query includes ORDER BY p.id to ensure results are consistently sorted.

‚úÖ How to Run
You can run the SQL file using a MySQL-compatible client or command-line tool:

mysql -u your_username -p your_database < joins_queries.sql
Ensure the Airbnb database and related tables are already created and populated.



# Advanced SQL: Subqueries

## üìÅ File: `subqueries.sql`

This file contains solutions for **Task 1: Practice Subqueries** as part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Advanced Module**.

---

## üß† Objective

To practice and master writing both **correlated** and **non-correlated subqueries** in SQL.

---

## üìå Task Overview

### üîπ 1. Non-Correlated Subquery ‚Äì Properties with High Average Ratings

**Goal:** Retrieve all properties where the **average review rating is greater than 4.0**

**SQL Logic:**

WHERE (
  SELECT AVG(r.rating)
  FROM reviews r
  WHERE r.property_id = p.id
) > 4.0;
This subquery does not depend on the outer query row-by-row.

It calculates the average rating for each property and filters accordingly.

üîπ 2. Correlated Subquery ‚Äì Users with More Than 3 Bookings
Goal: Retrieve users who have made more than 3 bookings

SQL Logic:
WHERE (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM bookings b
  WHERE b.user_id = u.id
) > 3;
This subquery is correlated, meaning it depends on each row in the outer users query.

For every user, it counts their bookings and includes them if the count exceeds 3.

‚úÖ How to Run
You can run the SQL file using a MySQL-compatible client or CLI:

mysql -u your_username -p your_database < subqueries.sql
Ensure the Airbnb database and related tables are already created and populated.

# Advanced SQL: Aggregations and Window Functions

## üìÅ File: `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`

This file contains solutions for **Task 2: Apply Aggregations and Window Functions** as part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Advanced Module**.

---

## üß† Objective

To use SQL aggregation functions and window functions to perform in-depth data analysis and ranking.

---

## üìå Task Overview

### üîπ 1. Aggregation ‚Äì Total Bookings Per User

**Goal:** Find the total number of bookings each user has made.

**SQL Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_bookings
FROM bookings
GROUP BY user_id;
In our query, we join with the users table to retrieve full user details and group the result by user ID.

Why this matters:
This helps identify highly active users or target frequent travelers for promotions.

üîπ 2. Window Function ‚Äì Rank Properties by Booking Count

**Goal:** Rank all properties by the number of bookings they have received using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function.

**SQL Logic:**

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.id) DESC) AS property_rank

Why this matters:
This allows hosts or platform admins to spot top-performing listings.
ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique ranking to each property based on its booking count.

We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure properties with no bookings are still included.

‚úÖ How to Run
Run the SQL file using a MySQL-compatible client:

mysql -u your_username -p your_database < aggregations_and_window_functions.sql
Ensure your Airbnb database and sample data are available.
